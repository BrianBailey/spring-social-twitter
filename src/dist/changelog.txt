Spring Social Twitter 1.0.4 (June 6, 2013)
==========================================
This release was pushed as an emergency release to enable creation
of a TwitterTemplate that supports application-only authorization.

Twitter's 1.0 API will be retired on June 11, 2013 and the 1.1 API
requires either user authorization or app authorization for all
resources. This release enables application authorization as an option
to user authorization for resources where application authorization is
available (such as search).

Improvements:
   * Support application-only authorization (e.g., OAuth 2's
     client credentials grant) in TwitterTemplate. (SOCIALTW-48)
   * Sync-up Twitter API binding to what's current in
     Spring Social Twitter 1.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.

Spring Social Twitter 1.0.3 (February 12, 2013)
===============================================     
Improvements:
   * Update API bindings to use Twitter's 1.1 API. (SOCIALTW-39)

Spring Social Twitter 1.0.2 (January 23, 2012)
===============================================
Bug Fixes:
   * Throw RateLimitExceededException when a user exceeds their
     daily status update limit. (It was throwing
     OperationNotPermittedException.) SOCIALTW-27

Improvements:
   * Capture "retweet_count" property on a Tweet object. SOCIALTW_26

Spring Social Twitter 1.0.1 (December 15, 2011)
===============================================
Bug Fixes:
   * Fixed the date format for daily trends (SOCIALTW-14)
   * Check for a list of errors vs. a single string error when
     consuming errors from Twitter's REST API (SOCIALTW-17)
   * Fixed UserList.isPublic() to be bound to "mode" property in
     JSON response (SOCIALTW-18)
   * Exposed BlockOperations through Twitter interface
     (SOCIALTW-20)

Improvement:
   * Added UserOperations.getRateLimitStatus() to API binding
     to fetch the rate limit data. (SOCIALTW-16)
   * Added restOperations() to Twitter interface to enable
     consumption of Twitter endpoints that aren't yet covered
     by the API binding (SOCIALTW-13)
   * Removed unused userId parameter from ListOperations.
     getListSubscribers(). (SOCIALTW-19)
   * SearchOperations.createSavedSearch now returns the newly
     created SavedSearch object. (SOCIALTW-21)
   * DirectMessageOperations.sendDirectMessage() returns the
     sent DirectMessage object. (SOCIALTW-22)
   * Added getDirectMessage(id) method to DirectMessageOperations
     (SOCIALTW-23)

Compatibility Note:
   * Twitter deprecated the current trends endpoint, and now 
     returns and HTTP 410 if you attempt to use it. Therefore,
     SearchOperations.getCurrentTrends() has been removed from the
     API binding. (SOCIALTW-15)
   * ListOperations.getListSubscribers() previous accepted a
     userId parameter that was unused. That parameter has now been
     removed.

     to be uploaded with status updates. (SOCIALTW-6)
   * Changed signature of TimelineOperations.updateStatus() to return
     a Tweet object for the newly created status; previously it returned
     void. (SOCIALTW-8)
   * Added an inReplyToStatusId property to StatusDetails so that tweets
     may be posted that are in reply to an existing tweet.

Spring Social Twitter 1.0.0 RC1 (July 26, 2011)
